    "In many industries, it is critical to extract custom entities from documents in a timely manner.  This can be challenging.  Insurance claims, for example, often contain dozens of important attributes (e.g. dates, names, locations, reports) sprinkled across lengthy and dense documents.  Manually scanning and extracting such information is, therefore, error-prone and time-consuming.  Rule-based software can help, but ultimately is too rigid to adapt to the many varying document types and layouts. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help automate and speed up this process, Amazon Comprehend can be used to detect custom entities quickly and accurately by leveraging machine learning.  This approach is flexible and accurate, because the system can adapt to new documents by leveraging what it has learned in the past.  Until recently, however, this capability could only be applied to plain text documents which meant that positional information was lost when converting the documents from their native format.  To address this, it was recently announced that Comprehend can now extract custom entities in native PDF and word format.  In this blog post, we will walk through a concrete example from the insurance industry of how you can build a custom recognizer using PDF annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will:\n",
    " * Set up IAM permissions to do custom training on Sagemaker \n",
    " * Explore the format of PDF annotations\n",
    " * Use the PDF annotations to train a custom model using the Python API\n",
    " * Obtain evaluation metrics from the trained model\n",
    " * Perform inference on an unseen document"
